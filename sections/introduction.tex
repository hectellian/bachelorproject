\section{Background}\label{background}}

The importance of hardware security has escalated in our increasingly digital world, where the proliferation of smart devices makes every aspect of our lives interconnected and, potentially, vulnerable. This surge in connectivity has broadened the attack surface for malicious actors, making hardware security a critical pillar of our digital infrastructure's integrity.

Video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Switch, epitomize the sophisticated nature of modern hardware. These devices are not merely platforms for entertainment but intricate ecosystems comprising proprietary software, custom hardware components, and online services. They embody a blend of performance, entertainment, and connectivity, making them a prime target for exploitation.

The Nintendo Switch, in particular, presents an intriguing case study in hardware security. Its popularity and unique design have attracted attention not only from millions of users worldwide but also from individuals and groups looking to exploit potential vulnerabilities for various purposes, ranging from piracy to the customization of the device beyond the manufacturer's intended limitations. The discovery of the Fusee Gelee vulnerability\cite{orlandUnpatchableExploitThat2018}, a significant exploit within the Switch's boot ROM, highlights the ongoing tension between hardware manufacturers, who strive to secure their devices, and the hacker community, which continually seeks to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

To understand the gravity of such exploits, one must consider the broader implications of hardware vulnerabilities. Unlike software flaws, which can often be patched through updates, vulnerabilities at the hardware level can be more challenging to address. They may require physical recalls or rely on mitigation strategies that can only minimize the risk rather than eliminate it. The presence of such vulnerabilities underscores the necessity of robust hardware security measures not only to protect intellectual property and user data but also to maintain trust in digital ecosystems.

\section{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

The primary objectives of this paper are designed to build a comprehensive understanding of hardware vulnerabilities, with a particular focus on the Fusee Gelee exploit within the Nintendo Switch, and to evaluate mitigation strategies that can be employed against such vulnerabilities. The objectives are outlined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Comprehensive Overview of Hardware Vulnerabilities}: To conduct a thorough literature review that maps the landscape of hardware vulnerabilities, categorizing them based on their nature, origin, and impact.

\item
  \textbf{In-depth Analysis of the Fusee Gelee Exploit}: To dissect the Fusee Gelee exploit in detail, examining how it was discovered, its technical mechanisms, and how it manages to circumvent the Nintendo Switch's security measures. This analysis will provide insights into the exploit's workings, offering a case study of how a single vulnerability can have significant ramifications.
\item
  \textbf{Assessment of Mitigation Strategies}: To evaluate existing strategies employed to mitigate hardware vulnerabilities, focusing on their applicability and effectiveness in the context of the Fusee Gelee exploit. This will involve an examination of both reactive measures taken post-discovery and proactive strategies that can be integrated into the design and manufacturing processes to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

This will include discussions on side-channel attacks, fault injection, hardware Trojans, and more, providing a broad perspective on the types of challenges faced in securing hardware.
\item
  \textbf{Objective 2}: The analysis of Fusee Gelee will be technical, involving an examination of the Tegra X1's boot ROM, the role of the BootROM bug, and how the vulnerability is exploited to run arbitrary code. It will also cover the implications of such an exploit, from the perspective of both security professionals and end-users.
\item
  \textbf{Objective 3}: The assessment will cover specific mitigation strategies, such as secure boot, hardware patches, and the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It will critically analyze the effectiveness of Nintendo's responses and general practices in the industry for preventing and responding to hardware vulnerabilities.

\hypertarget{scope}{%
\section{Scope}\label{scope}}

While the Fusee Gelee exploit within the Nintendo Switch serves as the
focal point of this paper, it is crucial to delineate the boundaries of
the discussion to maintain a focused and coherent analysis. The scope of
this paper includes the points talked about in the Objectives

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

To ensure a focused analysis, the paper will not cover:
