## Background

The realm of hardware security has become increasingly paramount in the digital age, where even the most seemingly innocuous devices can host complex and exploitable vulnerabilities. The case of video game consoles, particularly the Nintendo Switch, serves as a poignant example. These consoles are not just entertainment devices but also sophisticated pieces of technology with robust security architectures designed to protect intellectual property and user data. However, the discovery of vulnerabilities like Fusee Gelee underscores the perpetual cat-and-mouse game between hardware manufacturers and hackers.

- Importance of hardware security in modern devices: With the ubiquity of smart devices, securing hardware has become as crucial as software security. Hardware vulnerabilities can lead to persistent and sometimes unpatchable exploits [HardwareSecurityImportance].
- Role of video game consoles in hardware security: Consoles like the Nintendo Switch represent a unique intersection of consumer electronics, proprietary software, and dedicated hardware, making them an interesting study in hardware security [NintendoSwitchSecurity].

## Thesis Statement

This paper delves into the Fusee Gelee exploit as a case study to shed light on broader issues surrounding hardware vulnerabilities. The exploit not only reveals specific flaws within the Nintendo Switch's security architecture but also illustrates the potential ramifications such vulnerabilities can have across similar devices and systems.

- Focus on Fusee Gelee: An examination of how the exploit was discovered, its workings, and its impact on the Nintendo Switch and the broader hardware security landscape [FuseeGeleeCaseStudy].

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this paper are threefold: to provide a comprehensive overview of hardware vulnerabilities through literature review, to analyze the specifics and implications of the Fusee Gelee exploit, and to assess various mitigation strategies that can be employed to counteract such vulnerabilities.

- Review of hardware vulnerabilities: A survey of existing literature on hardware vulnerabilities, categorizing and understanding their nature and impact [HardwareVulnerabilitiesReview].
- In-depth analysis of the Fusee Gelee exploit: Technical analysis of the exploit, including how it bypasses the Nintendo Switch's security measures [FuseeGeleeAnalysis].
- Assessment of mitigation strategies: Evaluation of current strategies to mitigate hardware vulnerabilities and their effectiveness in the context of the Fusee Gelee exploit [MitigationStrategies].

## Scope

While this paper will focus on the Fusee Gelee exploit within the Nintendo Switch, it's crucial to acknowledge that the findings and discussions herein have broader implications for hardware security in various other devices and contexts. However, the scope will be deliberately narrowed to maintain a focused and in-depth analysis.

- Limitation of discussion: The paper will not cover all aspects of hardware security but will instead provide a focused look at a significant case study that highlights key issues and considerations [ScopeLimitation].

## Structure

The paper is structured to guide the reader through a logical progression of topics, starting with a background on hardware security, followed by an in-depth examination of the Fusee Gelee exploit, and culminating in a discussion of mitigation strategies and implications for the future of hardware security.
