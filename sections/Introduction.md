The realm of hardware security has become increasingly paramount in the digital age, where even the most seemingly innocuous devices can host complex and exploitable vulnerabilities. The case of video game consoles, particularly the Nintendo Switch, serves as a poignant example. These consoles are not just entertainment devices but also sophisticated pieces of technology with robust security architectures designed to protect intellectual property and user data. However, the discovery of vulnerabilities like Fusee Gelee underscores the perpetual cat-and-mouse game between hardware manufacturers and hackers.
